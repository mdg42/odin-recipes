An initial website to practice using HTML skills. The focus of this work was to utilize the basics of HTML in website design.
Additionally, this project gave practice in building a repository and using git. Next steps in learning are to improve atomic 
commits and developing a better workflow. Currently, there is too much bouncing around before a commit.
