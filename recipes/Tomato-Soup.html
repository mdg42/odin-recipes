    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy tomato soup is my go-to recipe. It's simple and delicious, ready in 30 minutes, and I give leftovers to my 
        kids for lunch. I usually serve it with rosemary bread for dunking.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter or margarine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>   
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>          
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</li>           
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes</li>            
        <li>1 cup water</li>            
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>            
        <li>¼ teaspoon celery seed</li>            
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>            
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>            
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook onion and garlic until onion is soft and translucent, 
            about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, water, sugar, celery seed, oregano, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil. 
            Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and puree with an immersion blender. Reheat soup until warm and season with salt and pepper.</li>
